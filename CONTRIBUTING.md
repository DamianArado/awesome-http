# Contributing

Thank you for taking interest in contributing to this project.

**Please do not edit README.md directly**

Instead, add the resource under its corresponding language to `resources.json` in the form of:

```json
{
  "Language Name": [
    ...,
    {
      "name": "name of the project",
      "repo": "github user/repo"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the programming language of your project is not currently a part of the file, feel free to add it.
